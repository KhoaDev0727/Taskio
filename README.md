SaaS Multi-Organization Work Management
üìã Overview
This project is a Software as a Service (SaaS) application designed for task and project management across multiple organizations (tenants). It provides a scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform to streamline collaborative workflows, inspired by tools like Trello or Asana. Built with a multi-tenant architecture, it ensures data isolation for each organization while running on a single codebase.
üéØ Purpose
The goal is to offer an efficient and customizable work management solution for teams and organizations to:

Organize tasks and projects.
Track progress, priorities, and deadlines.
Facilitate team collaboration through comments, checklists, and file attachments.
Support multiple organizations with isolated data and flexible subscription plans.

üë• Target Audience

Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs): Startups, agencies, or small companies needing cost-effective task management.
Freelance and Remote Teams: For managing client projects or remote collaboration.
Large Organizations: With multiple departments requiring isolated project management.
Individual Users: For personal task management with a free plan.
SaaS Developers: Looking to customize or resell a work management solution.

‚ú® Key Features

Multi-Tenant Architecture: Each organization (tenant) has isolated data with unique slugs.
User Management: Supports user roles (OWNER, ADMIN, MEMBER, VIEWER) with JWT-based authentication and refresh tokens.
Project Management: Create and manage projects with unique keys, names, and descriptions.
Task Management: Tasks with titles, descriptions, assignees, reporters, status (todo/in_progress/done), priorities, due dates, and time estimates.
Collaboration Tools:
Labels: Categorize tasks with colored labels.
Comments: Discuss tasks with mentions (JSONB support).
Attachments: Store file metadata (e.g., S3 URLs).
Checklists: Create and track checklist items within tasks.


Teams: Group users within a tenant for collaboration.
Search: Full-text search for tasks using PostgreSQL GIN index.
Audit and Soft Delete: Tracks creation/update timestamps and soft deletes for data recovery.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

Backend: Java Spring Boot with JPA/Hibernate.
Database: PostgreSQL with extensions (pgcrypto for UUIDs, btree_gin for indexing).
Security: JWT authentication, password hashing, refresh tokens.
Entities: Tenant, User, Role, UserRole, Project, Task, Label, TaskLabel, Comment, Attachment, Checklist, ChecklistItem, Team.
Features:
Multi-tenant data isolation via tenant_id.
Unique constraints for tenant-specific data (e.g., project key/name).
Database triggers for automatic updated_at timestamps.
Indexes for performance optimization.



üöÄ Getting Started

Setup Database: Initialize PostgreSQL with the provided schema (includes tables, constraints, and triggers).
Configure Backend: Set up Spring Boot with dependencies for JPA, security, and JWT.
Seed Data: Populate the roles table with roles (e.g., OWNER, ADMIN).
Run Application: Use AuthService for user registration, login, and token refresh.
Extend: Add REST API controllers and a frontend (e.g., React) for a complete solution.

üîÆ Future Enhancements

REST API endpoints for task/project management.
Frontend interface for user interaction.
Integration with cloud storage (e.g., S3) for attachments.
Billing system for subscription plans.
Notification and reporting features.
